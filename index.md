Please feel free to pass along this application to others. **This application will close on Friday, January 21, 2022.**

## Workshop Description

Climate change touches many aspects of life and is a top challenge facing future generations in North Carolina. Many publicly available datasets exist to support adaptation and resiliency in the face of climate change. However, these data can often be difficult for communities to access, analyze, interpret, and put into action given their local knowledge and lived experiences. 

To initiate steps to overcome these hurdles, this virtual workshop will:

1. **facilitate collaborations** between communities, organizations, climate scientists, and data scientists with shared goals and interests

2. **build capacity** for North Carolinians to use publicly available (i.e., "open data") weather and climate data along with reproducible science practices (i.e., "open science")

For a **complete schedule of the workshop**, visit the ["Schedule" tab](https://open-climate-data-science.github.io/schedule/) of this website.

This workshop is open to all people, communities, and organizations who are interested in using publicly available data along with reproducible science practices to address the impacts of climate change in their communities.

## Organization & Sponsorship
