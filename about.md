## Workshop Description

### Motivation 

Climate change touches many aspects of life and is a top challenge facing future generations in North Carolina. Many publicly available datasets exist to support adaptation and resiliency in the face of climate change. However, these data can often be difficult for communities to access, analyze, interpret, and put into action given their local knowledge and lived experiences. 

<br>

### Goals

To initiate steps to overcome these hurdles, this virtual workshop will:

1. **facilitate collaborations** between communities, organizations, climate scientists, and data scientists with shared goals and interests

2. **build capacity** to use publicly available (i.e., "open data") weather and climate data along with reproducible science practices (i.e., "open science") and local knowledge

<br>

### Intended Audience

This workshop is open to all people, communities, and organizations who are interested in using publicly available data along with reproducible science practices to address the impacts of climate change in their communities.
